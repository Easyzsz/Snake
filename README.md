# Snake:

java script and p5 implementation of the classic video game Snake.

## Game Rules:

The player attempts to eat items by running into them with the head of the snake. 
Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so avoiding collision with the snake becomes progressively more difficult.
The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.
